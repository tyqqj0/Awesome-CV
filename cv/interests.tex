% My research interests lie in the field of medical image segmentation, with a particular focus on leveraging the reasoning capabilities of large language models to enhance segmentation performance. This interest has led me to explore the following research direction:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Integrating the visual reasoning and medical knowledge inference capabilities of large language models into medical image analysis models.} Specifically, I aim to investigate how the medical knowledge learned by pre-trained language models from textual data such as medical literature and patient reports can guide image segmentation models to more accurately identify lesion regions. At the same time, the strong visual understanding abilities of language models have the potential to help segmentation models better comprehend image content and anatomical structures. By cleverly designing multimodal learning frameworks that enable language models and image segmentation models to complement each other, I believe we can significantly enhance the intelligence level of medical image analysis.
